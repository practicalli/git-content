# Overview

Why should we care about our commit messages or commit history ?
    
I have seem hundreds of comments on stack exchange and forum and on team IM's similar to the following:
  
  _"I've run into a problem we had a few weeks ago, but I cant remember what I did to fix it"_

  Being able to look back in history to see how you fixed previous bugs means you can fix them again really quickly, **when** they happen again.  This is even more useful when you quickly scan your history and see how others in your team have solved issues.
  
  All this is possible if you have a meaningful and clean commit history.
