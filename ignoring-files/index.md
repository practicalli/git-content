# Ignoring files

  By telling git to ignore files that are not relvant to the project you can help keep your commits nice and clean.  For example, if you dont exclude compiled classes directory, then each time you compile your code someone could add those changes.
  
  Not only does this make the git repository bigger than it needs to be, it also makes it harder to see the relevant changes made for a particular commit.
