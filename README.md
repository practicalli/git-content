# Git, Practical.li 

  Git can be as simple or as complex as the situation requires, however most of the time you can use git very simply and only need a handful of the git commands.
  
  When you are startging out with git then you learn git init, git commit, git status, git log 
  
  If you have a shared repository, then you learn git clone, git pull & git push 
  
  
## Clean commits

* Meainingful commits 
  - smallest possible commit that has value
  - interactive adding of changes
  - amending commits (? squashing commits)
  
* Descriptive commit messages
* Making good use of all the different stages: stash, working copy, index, local repo, shared repo
* Using Git tools well 
* Avoid re-writing history (unless it gives a better history of commits)
* Avoid changing shared history (unless you want to loose all your friends)



## Git workflow

  Just like any other development workflow, a good Git workflow shold be measured by the relevance to the project and team using that workflow.
